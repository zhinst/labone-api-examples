function hdawg_example_awg_grouped_mode(device_id)
% Demonstrate how to connect to a Zurich Instruments HDAWG and run it in grouped mode.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% USAGE 
% The example can be execute with the command:
%
% hdawg_example_awg_commandtable(device_id)
%
% device_id should be a string, e.g., 'dev1000' or 'hdawg-dev1000'.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTES
%
% This example can only be ran on HDAWG instruments.
%
% Additional configuration: Connect wave outputs 1 and 2 of HDAWG to input channels 1 and 2 of an
% osciloscope with an SMA/BNC cable. The generated signals are Gaussian with opposite signs and equal
% amplitudes 
%
%
% Please ensure that the ziDAQ folders 'Driver' and 'Utils' are in your MATLAB path. To do this
% (temporarily) for one MATLAB session please navigate to the ziDAQ base folder containing the
% 'Driver', 'Examples' and 'Utils' subfolders and run the MATLAB function ziAddPath().
% >>> ziAddPath;
%
% To obtain help on all the available ziDAQ commands, use either of the 
% commands:
% >>> help ziDAQ
% >>> doc ziDAQ

clear ziDAQ;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this example the device is configured to control groups of 4 outputs with a single sequencer
% program (channel grouping 1). It is also possible to control groups of 2 outputs (channel grouping
% 0) or 8 outputs (channel grouping 2).
% After specifying the grouping mode, specify which group to use and set the output gains for each
% AWG core in the group. Then set the output range for each channel in the group and switch the
% channels on.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
grouping = 1;   % Channel grouping 2x4
awg_group = 0;  % AWG group
range = 1.0;    % Output range [V]

awg_cores = awg_group * 2^grouping + (0:2^grouping-1);
channels = awg_group * 2^(grouping+1) + (0:2^grouping-1);

% Grouping mode

%% AWG sequencer program
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% waveforms `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` by the instruction `placeholder`. Both the command table and the
% waveform data for the placeholders need to be uploaded separately before this sequence program can
% be run.

% After defining the sequencer program, this must be compiled before being uploaded. The compilation
% is done using the LabOne module `awgModule`.
