function hdawg_example_awg_commandtable(device_id)
% Demonstrate how to connect to a Zurich Instruments HDAWG and upload and run an AWG program using 
%the command table.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% USAGE 
% The example can be execute with the command:
%
% hdawg_example_awg_commandtable(device_id)
%
% device_id should be a string, e.g., 'dev8001' or 'hdawg-dev8001'.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTES
%
% This example can only be ran on HDAWG instruments.
%
% Additional configuration: Connect wave outputs 1 and 2 of HDAWG to input channels 1 and 2 of an
% osciloscope with an SMA/BNC cable. The generated signals are Gaussian with opposite signs and equal
% amplitudes 
%
%
% Please ensure that the ziDAQ folders 'Driver' and 'Utils' are in your MATLAB path. To do this
% (temporarily) for one MATLAB session please navigate to the ziDAQ base folder containing the
% 'Driver', 'Examples' and 'Utils' subfolders and run the MATLAB function ziAddPath().
% >>> ziAddPath;
%
% To obtain help on all the available ziDAQ commands, use either of the 
% commands:
% >>> help ziDAQ
% >>> doc ziDAQ

clear ziDAQ;

% waveforms `p1` and `p2` by the instruction `placeholder`. Both the command table and the waveform
% data for the placeholders need to be uploaded separately before this sequence program can be run.
