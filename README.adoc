= Zurich Instruments LabOne API examples

This repository contains various examples for controlling Zurich Instruments devices through the LabOne APIs.

Only Python examples can be found in this repository right now. Examples for other APIs will move here soon. Until then, you can find examples for C, MATLAB, .NET, and LabVIEW in the https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_api/index.html[LabOne API documentation] or inside your LabOne installation.

----
<1> The `common` directory contains examples valid for all instruments.
<2> Instrument specific examples are located in the respective directory
<3> Each directory is separated into the different APIs (e.g. python)
<4> General helper functions are located in the `utils` directory

== Python API

In order to run the Python examples, you need to have the latest https://pypi.org/project/zhinst/[`zhinst`] package installed and https://www.zhinst.com/others/instruments/labone/labone-all-in-one[LabOne] up and running. (Please refer to the https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_programming_manual/overview.html[LabOne User Manual] for further information.)

The Python examples are designed in a way that they can be run from the command line:
....
$ python path/to/example.py --help
....

Each example has a `run_example` function that contains the example source.
Feel free to experiment, change or copy parts of the examples.
