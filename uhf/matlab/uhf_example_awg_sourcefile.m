function uhf_example_awg_sourcefile(device_id, varargin)
% UHF_EXAMPLE_AWG_SOURCEFILE demonstrates how to connect to a
% Zurich Instruments Arbitrary Waveform Generator and compile/upload
% an AWG program to the instrument.
%
% USAGE UHF_EXAMPLE_AWG_SOURCEFILE(DEVICE_ID)
% USAGE UHF_EXAMPLE_AWG_SOURCEFILE(DEVICE_ID, FILE_NAME)
%
% DEVICE_ID should be a string, e.g., 'dev2006' or 'uhf-dev2006'.
% FILE_NAME is the name of the SeqC file without a suffix.
%
% NOTE This example can only be ran on UHF instruments with the AWG option
% enabled or on UHFAWG instruments.
%
% NOTE Additional configuration: Connect signal output 1 to signal input 1
% with a BNC cable.
%
% NOTE Please ensure that the ziDAQ folders 'Driver' and 'Utils' are in your
% Matlab path. To do this (temporarily) for one Matlab session please navigate
% to the ziDAQ base folder containing the 'Driver', 'Examples' and 'Utils'
% subfolders and run the Matlab function ziAddPath().
% >>> ziAddPath;
%
% Use either of the commands:
% >>> help ziDAQ
% >>> doc ziDAQ
% in the Matlab command window to obtain help on all available ziDAQ commands.
